## The Things Network New York Test Blog

- This is an initial test using the [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) format. It uses the `React.js` framework. Check it out on GitHub.

Currently it is running on local while we test it and pitch the membership at: `http://0.0.0.0:8000`

### Sharing what we're doing

- Our core members are always working on neat projects, and while most of us keep tabs on what is being built internally, having a blog provides a nice way to reach a little bit further. Hopefully it will be useful for those either curious what we're up to, or those who are looking to gain some additional familiarity with LoRaWAN, The Things Network, embedded systems, and RF.
