## The Things Network New York Test Blog

- This is an initial test using the **[Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby)** format. It uses the React.js framework. Check it out on GitHub.

Currently it is running on local while we test it and pitch the membership at: `http://0.0.0.0:8000`

### Sharing what we're doing

- Our core members are always working on neat projects. While most of us keep tabs on what is being built internally, having a blog provides a nice way to reach a little bit further, and share what we're doing with people who might be further removed from our team. Hopefully it will be useful for those looking to gain some familiarity with using LoRaWAN, The Things Network, embedded systems, and RF. Check it out.
