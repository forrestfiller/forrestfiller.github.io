# A Test Blog for The Things Network New York

- This is an initial test using the [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby) format.

### Sharing what we're doing

- Our core members are always working on neat projects, and while most of us keep tabs on what is being built internally, having a blog provides a nice way to reach a little bit further. Hopefully it will be useful for those either curious what we're up to, or those who are looking to gain some additional familiarity with LoRaWAN, The Things Network, embedded systems, and RF. Check it out.
